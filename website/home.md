## What is it?

Grow3.js is a recursive object generator for JavaScript. You can use its API to define rules that build three dimensional structures.

#### Main features:

* Intuitive set of movements, rotations and scales.
* Integrated basic building blocks: *cubes*, *spheres*, *text* and arbitrary *meshes*.
* Rich set of helper functions.
* Based on [THREE.js](http://threejs.org/ "THREE.js"). Easy to integrate materials and other features.
* Integrated positioning of camera and lights.
* Created objects can be viewed using `grow3.Runner`

Grow3.js is inspired by [L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), [lparser](http://laurenslapre.nl/lapre_004.htm) and [Structure Synth](http://structuresynth.sourceforge.net).
