### What is it?

Grow3.js is a recursive 3D object generator for JavaScript. You can use its API to define rules that build nice three
dimensional structures.

**Main features:**

* Intuitive set of movements, rotations and scales.
* Integrated basic building blocks: *cubes*, *spheres*, *text* and arbitrary *meshes*.
* Rich set of helper functions.
* Based on [THREE.js](http://threejs.org/ "THREE.js") and [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org). Easy to integrate materials and other features.
* Integrated positioning of camera and lights.
* Created objects can be viewed using `grow3.Runner`
