## What is it?

Grow3.js is a recursive object generator for JavaScript. You can use its API to define rules that build three dimensional structures.

#### Main features:

* Intuitive set of movements, rotations and scales.
* Integrated basic building blocks: *cubes*, *text* and arbitrary *meshes*.
* Rich set of helper functions.
* Based on [THREE.js](http://threejs.org/ "THREE.js"). Easily integrate materials and other features.
* Integrated positioning of camera and lights.
* Created objects can be presented using `grow3.Runner`

Grow3.js is inspired by [L-Systems](TODO), [lparser](TODO) and [Structure Synth](TODO).
